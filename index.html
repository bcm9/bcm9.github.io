    <h3>About Me</h3>
        Hello, my name is Ben. I'm a researcher and analyst based in London. I'm interested in using technology and innovation to support health and wellbeing. I'm particularly interested in:
        <ul>
            <li>Conducting controlled and real-world evaluations of medical devices and health technologies, ensuring a balanced approach to development.</li>
            <!-- <li>Advancing the understanding and treatment of hearing loss, focusing on the personalisation of hearing devices to meet individual benefit and satisfaction.</li> -->
            <li>Leveraging technology to streamline operational processes within care pathways, freeing up time for face-to-face interactions that bring patients and clinicians closer together.</li>
            <li>Applying programming and statistics to data (machine learning, NLP) to better personalise care for individual patient benefit and satisfaction.</li>
            <!-- <li>Programming to drive statistical insights, develop machine learning solutions, communicate data through visualizations, and automate tasks.</li> -->
            <li>Integrating health economic modelling to inform decision-making in the development and implementation of cost-effective technologies.</li>
        </ul>
        My experience spans laboratory research, observational studies, literature reviews, clinical trials, qualitative research, and economic assessments, facilitating a holistic approach to health innovation.</p>
