    <h1>Benjamin Caswell-Midwinter</h1>
    <h2>Researcher in London, UK | Health Technology Assessment, Audiology</h2>
    <h3>About Me</h3>
        I am a researcher with a blend of expertise in auditory science and health technology assessment.
        Ultimately, my goal is to enhance health outcomes through evidence-based innovation. I'm particularly interested in:
        <ul>
            <li>Conducting clinical, operational, and economic evaluations of new medical devices and health technologies, ensuring a balanced approach to innovation.</li>
            <li>Advancing the understanding and treatment of hearing impairment, with a focus on the personalisation of hearing devices to meet individual needs.</li>
            <li>Leveraging technology in clinical settings to streamline processes, freeing up time for face-to-face behavioural treatments.</li>
            <li>Programming to drive insights through statistical analysis, develop solutions using machine learning, communicate data through visualizations, and automate tasks.</li>
            <li>Applying machine learning for diagnostics, using natural language processing for qualitative analysis of surveys, and building health economic models to inform decision-making.</li>
        </ul>
        With experience ranging from the intricate details of hearing science and lab research to the broader scope of health technology, I ensure a holistic approach to innovation in my work.</p>
