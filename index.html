    <h1>Benjamin Caswell-Midwinter</h1>
    <h2>Researcher in London, UK | Hearing, Health, Technology, Evaluation</h2>
    <h3>About Me</h3>
        I am a researcher with a blend of expertise in hearing science and health technology assessment.
        Ultimately, my goal is to enhance health outcomes through evidence-based innovation. I'm particularly interested in:
        <ul>
            <li>Conducting clinical, operational, and economic evaluations of new medical devices and health technologies, ensuring a balanced approach to innovation.</li>
            <li>Advancing the understanding and treatment of hearing impairment, with a focus on the personalisation of hearing devices to meet individual needs.</li>
            <li>Leveraging technology in clinical settings to streamline processes, freeing up time for face-to-face behavioural treatments.</li>
            <li>Programming to drive statistical insights, develop machine learning solutions, communicate data through visualizations, and automate tasks.</li>
            <li>Machine learning diagnostics, natural language processing for qualitative analysis, and health economic models to inform decision-making.</li>
        </ul>
        My experience spans laboratory research, literature reviews, clinical trials, observational studies, qualitative research, and economic assessments, ensuring a holistic and balanced approach to innovation in health technology.</p>
